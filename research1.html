      <p>
      It's somehow still an open question whether incoming radiation (photons, charged particles) affect qubit decoherence time. 
      Knowing that shooting things at a qubit make it change states would be important for quantum computing by calling for a focus on radiation shielding. Not only that, but we could also tell whether the qubit had something shot at it, which has applications in many subfields, from cosmic microwave background (CMB) recievers to dark matter detectors.
      I'm working with Dr. Noah Kurinsky at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and a team at Northwestern and Fermilab, using a qubit in a dilution refrigerator at the Northwestern EXperimental Underground Site (NEXUS) to answer this question.

      <p>
	Much like LIGO uses the interference between photons to detect gravitational waves, the MAGIS experiment aims to use atomic states of strontium to the same end. Lasers are used extensively to cool, excite, and even move around these atoms. During my rotation with Professor Jason Hogan, I worked on the design and testing of part of the optical system for the delivery of these lasers. I also assembled and aligned a 922 nm (infrared) laser.

    </div>
    <div id="2" style="display: none">
      <p>
	The axion is the most promising candidate for dark matter to date. Axions are directly detected in labs using resonating chambers called haloscopes. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, axions convert into photons of frequency equivalent to their mass. The resonant frequency of the haloscope thus decides what mass of axion it's sensitive to. By tuning the haloscope, we can become sensitive to different masses, either eliminate the possibility that axions have that mass, or if we're lucky, make a detection.
      </p>
      <p>
	I worked on a novel haloscope designed by Professor Chao-Lin Kuo, which is physically large, allowing for fast scan rates, but resonating at a high frequency. We are thus able to explore a hitherto uncharted region of axion parameter space... eventually. So far, I've demonstrated that the prototype haloscope (pictured) is tunable and has the frequency we expect. We still need to scale up to a larger version, test it at cryogenic temperatures, implement a superconducting amplifier for our signals, and borrow a huge magnet from ADMX. I'll try to keep this updated.
